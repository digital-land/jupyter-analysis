README: Collecting and Managing Data Workflow
=============================================

Overview
--------
This project automates a data processing workflow by executing multiple Python scripts stored in a `scripts/` directory. The outputs are saved in a designated `outputs/` folder, and detailed logs are recorded in `workflow_log.txt`.

The workflow is coordinated using a script called `workflow_runner.py`, which:
- Scans the `scripts/` folder for all Python scripts (excluding those prefixed with `_`)
- Executes each script in sequence using the Python environment it is launched in
- Passes an `--output-dir` argument to each script
- Logs all progress and errors to a log file

Folder Structure
----------------
The root directory should be laid out as follows:

collecting_and_managing_data/
├── workflow.py                    # Main script to orchestrate batch runs
├── workflow_log.txt               # Log file generated by the runner
├── setup_env.bat                  # Batch file for creating virtual environment and installing dependencies
├── outputs/                       # Directory where script outputs are saved
├── scripts/                       # Folder containing all executable Python scripts
│   ├── endpoints_missing_doc_urls.py
│   ├── odp_conformance.py
│   ├── odp_issue_summary.py
│   ├── odp_status.py
│   └── [other scripts...]
└── documentation/
    └── specification.csv          # Used by some scripts for validation
    └──output_dir.txt              # Output directory for saving tables. Will save locally in outputs if empty.

How to Run
----------
1. Set up your Python environment and install required packages using the command: setup_env.bat
2. Activate venv using: .venv\Scripts\activate.
3. Write output pathway in output_dir.txt if needed.
4. Run the workflow manager using: python workflow_runner.py

Each script in the `scripts/` folder will be executed in order, and their output saved into the `outputs/` directory (unless specified otherwise).

Output Location
---------------
Currently, all outputs are saved to the local `outputs/` folder within the root directory. However, this is configurable.

NOTE: The `--output-dir` argument passed to each script can (and will) be changed in future deployments to direct output to a SharePoint-mounted drive or other remote storage location.

Logging
-------
All progress and errors are timestamped and recorded in `workflow_log.txt`, located in the root directory.
