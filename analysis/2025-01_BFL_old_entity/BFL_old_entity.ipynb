    "## Analysis steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected steps:\n",
    "* For each organisation, get table of: organisation, resource, start-date, reference\n",
    "* Take the latest (non-200, with more than 0 entities) resource for each organisation\n",
    "* For any references from not latest resources, use end-date as end-date for entities with that reference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE - we should only run this for organisations supplying authoritative data, as otherwise it will get confusing factoring in orgs like GLA who can supply data for multiple organisations. This method of working out latest entities relies on a model of on organisation supplying successive data about the same things through one or multiple endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE - some organisations are using end-date (e.g. Bristol), we should make sure to only apply this calculated end date to entities which don't already have one from the org.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "* Is taking resource with latest start date robust enough to identify latest snapshot of data? What if an endpoint for 2022 data has a mistake corrected which generates a newer resource than an endpoint with 2024 data has? Should we use the latest resource from latest endpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggest here we actually begin giving old endpoints for orgs an end date, it will make the logic of working out what end-date to give old entities SO much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What about orgs like Bucks who have multiple active endpoints to supply data for multiple regions? Can't reliably identify latest data between this model and single dataset model. May have to manually exclude orgs like Bucks, or maybe restrict method to only orgs with single active endpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to deal with entities with data from old resources that don't appear in reporting or collection tables? e.g. Bristol entity [1725409](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/entity/1725409) has reference facts from resource `01307bca0ecc5c950ef9b35c02ee7b3378cd9b7d29078229e4984a88d4f04ed1`. This appears in the `resource.csv` with an end-date, but isn't in `old-resource.csv`, or in the BFL `dataset_resource` or `fact_resource` tables. So not easy to work out an end-date for it from just the sqlite file. Will probably need to separately check for any more of these and then they can just be retired.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks:\n",
    "* Using endpoint_entry_date as a proxy for the data lineage will be wrong in some cases, e.g. [Brighton and Hove](https://datasette.planning.data.gov.uk/performance?sql=SELECT+*%2C%0D%0A++++CAST%28endpoint_no+as+string%29+%7C%7C+%22.%22+%7C%7C+dense_rank%28%29+over+%28partition+by+endpoint_no+order+by+resource_start_date%29+as+endpoint_resource_no%0D%0A%0D%0AFROM+%28%0D%0ASELECT+distinct+organisation%2C+organisation_name%2C+dataset%2C+latest_status%2C+endpoint_url%2C+endpoint%2C+endpoint_entry_date%2C+endpoint_end_date%2C+resource%2C+resource_start_date%2C+resource_end_date%2C%0D%0A+++dense_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+endpoint_entry_date%2C+endpoint%29+as+endpoint_no%0D%0AFROM+reporting_historic_endpoints%0D%0AWHERE+pipeline+%3D+%22brownfield-land%22%0D%0AAND+organisation+%3D+%22local-authority%3ABNH%22%0D%0AAND+latest_status+%3D+200%0D%0AORDER+BY+endpoint_entry_date%2C+resource_start_date%0D%0A++%29) got 2017 and 2018 data added on the same day in 2019. So references which appeared in one and not the other may get an unusual end-date."
