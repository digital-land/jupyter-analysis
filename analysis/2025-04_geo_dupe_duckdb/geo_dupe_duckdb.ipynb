    "# Geo dupes in DuckDB\n",
    "**Author**:  Greg Slater <br>\n",
    "**Date**:  24th September 2024 <br>\n",
    "**Dataset Scope**: `dataset` <br>\n",
    "**Report Type**: Ad-hoc analysis <br>\n",
    "**Purpose**: Minimal reproduction of method used in [conservation area geo duplicates report](https://github.com/digital-land/jupyter-analysis/blob/main/reports/find_conservation_area_duplicates/map_conservation_area_duplicates.ipynb), using duckdb instead of geopandas as this may be closer to the aproach that is required to identify geo-duplicates for any dataset in expectations or as part of the add-data command.\n"
